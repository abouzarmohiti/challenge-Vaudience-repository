# challenge-Vaudience-repository
project challenge for Vaudience company

I created a project with the help of the Spring.io site by adding the dependencies such as Spring Web, spring-boot-starter-data-JPA, H2 Database, and Lombok.

The project has 4 main layers:
* model
* repository
* service
* API
###### And there is a package for exceptions class
